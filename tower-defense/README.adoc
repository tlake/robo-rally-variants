=== Robot Death
When a robot dies on the board, they will leave behind debris (marked by a damage token).
If another robot runs over the debris, the token is removed and that robot heals one.

=== Ramps and Levels

==== Ramps
It takes forward 2 movement points to go up a ramp; this can be can be done with a Move 2+ (or a Backup 2+), or take two phases in the same turn with Move 1's (or Backup 1's).

==== Falling from upper level
Robot takes 2 points of damage.
If a robot lands on another robot they each take 1 point of damage instead, and the falling robot is moved one random square from where they fell on the ground level.

==== Levels
Laser fire can only hit on the same height, unless rules state otherwise. 


=== Towers
Towers choose their targets by the active robot (must have moved in that phase; a robot which is powered-down or is using _Brakes_ is not considered moving) that is closest to them first.
In case of a tie they target the active robot closest to flag 6.

The number of pips on the die is the number of hit points for that tower.

==== Laser Towers
Marked by six side die.
Follow normal laser rules.

==== Howitzer Towers
Marked by non-six sided die.

Indirect Fire, Range 8, Damage 2, Splash.
Shooting up a level: -1 Range.
Shooting down a level: +1 Range.
Use the <<Accuracy Table>> for where the shell lands.
Splash damage does not hurt firing tower (they are prepared for it).

=== Drones
Marked by life token.
Drones move each phase with a movement of 2 after all robots have moved for the phase.
Drones choose their targets by the active robot (must have moved in that phase; a robot which is powered-down or is using _Brakes_ is not considered moving) that is closest to them first.
In case of a tie they target the active robot closes to flag 6.
If a drone “lands” on an active robot, it does 4 points of damage with splash damage.

=== Accuracy Table

[options="header"]
|===
| Percentage | Targeting
| 01-15 | Off by 3 square
| 16-25 | Off by 2 square
| 26-65 | Off by 1 square
| 66-100 | On Target

If an event causes a robot to die, the next turn will also have a tower event.
